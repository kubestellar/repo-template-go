## Getting Started

### Issues

Before reporting a new issue, please search our issue archive to see if it has already been reported or resolved.

To claim an issue that you are interested in, assign it to yourself by leaving a comment `/assign`. You may also remove yourself from an issue with `/unassign` in a comment.

### Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request, clear communication is appreciated. This can be achieved by providing:

- Detailed description of the problem you are trying to solve, along with links to related GitHub issues
- Explanation of your solution, including links to any design documentation and discussions
- Information on how you tested and validated your solution
- Updates to relevant documentation and examples, if applicable

### Commits

In conformance with CNCF expectations, we will only merge commits that indicate your agreement with the Developer Certificate of Origin. This is indicated by doing a Git "sign-off" on the commit:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```
